## Translation Guidelines

### Style Guide

1. **Tone**: Professional, clear, and concise
2. **Technical Terms**: Keep technical terms in English with Persian explanation in parentheses on first use
3. **Code Examples**: Keep code unchanged, translate only comments and explanations
4. **Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting between English and Persian versions

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Considerations

- Ensure proper RTL layout in Persian documents
- Use appropriate Unicode characters for Persian text
- Test rendering in both LTR and RTL contexts

### Quality Assurance

- Technical review by bilingual developers
- Consistency check across all documents
- Link validation in both language versions
- Regular updates to maintain synchronization

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1: High Priority Docs | 2 weeks | README, QUICKSTART, API-REF, INSTALLATION |
| Phase 2: Medium Priority Docs | 3 weeks | CONFIGURATION, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT, DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, TROUBLESHOOTING |
| Phase 3: Low Priority Docs | 1 week | CONTRIBUTING, TESTING, FAQ, CHANGELOG |
| Phase 4: Review & QA | 1 week | Complete review and quality assurance |

**Total Estimated Duration:** 7 weeks

## Maintenance Strategy

- Update translations within 48 hours of English document changes
- Maintain version tags for both language sets
- Use automated tools for detecting untranslated content
- Regular audits every quarter

## Translation Tools

- Primary: Professional human translation
- Assistance: GPT-4 for initial drafts (with human review)
- Validation: Native Persian speakers for final review
- Version Control: Git-based workflow with separate commits per language
